**Hallo!** I'm Albert, a freelancing open-source software developer. Most of my
work is on [pandoc](https://pandoc.org), the universal document converter /
publishing system: I develop new Haskell libraries, create and maintain Lua
extensions, provide support, provide Docker images, and generally work to keep
the "ecosystem" in good shape.

Come and say hi, links are in the sidebar!
