**Hallo!** I'm Albert, a freelancing open-source software developer. Most of my
work is on [pandoc][], the universal document converter / publishing system: I
develop new Haskell libraries, create and maintain [Lua extensions][], provide
[support][pandoc-discuss], tend for the [Docker images][], and generally strive
to move the system forward all while keeping the "ecosystem" in good shape.

If those sound like worthy tasks, or if you are using any of these parts, why
not become a [sponsor]?

Either way, come and say hi, links are in the sidebar!
